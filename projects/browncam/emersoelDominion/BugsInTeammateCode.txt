Bug Title:	Too Many Actions from Village
Priority:	Medium
Environment:	OSU school server running Linux (on an Intel Xeon CPU X5650  @ 2.67GHz)
Description:	When a player plays the Village card, they are granted +5 actions instead of
		the typical +2 actions. This results in odd behavior, as the turn takes longer to 
		end, giving that player more opportunities to play other cards. Also, for some reason, the Estate deck is decremented whenever the Village card is played over a series of tests. 
		This likely results from the extended action phase and players acquiring estate cards during them.
Reproduce it:	Play Village from hand. 
Expected:	Player received +2 actions before the Village Card is then discarded.
Actual:		Player received +5 actions before the Village Card is finally discarded.

Bug Title:	Smithy Only Gives Two Cards
Priority:	High
Environment: 	OSU school server running Linux (on an Intel Xeon CPU X5650  @ 2.67GHz)
Description:	When a player plays the Smithy card, they are granted +2 cards instead of the 
		typical +3 cards. The implications of this may not seem high, but a series of unit tests showed that this bug also results in changes in the playerâ€™s action count as well as a change 
		in the Estate deck. This strange behavior shows that the bug interferes with the functionality of the overall game in ways that are difficult to predict.
Reproduce it:	Play Smithy from hand.
Expected:	Player received +3 cards into their hand and receives no +Action.
Actual:		Player received +2 cards into their hand and somehow has a change in Actions.
